- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Richard Ren. I'm interested in tech, policy, and the intersection of the two.
- ğŸ‘€ On the technical side, I'm currently interested in artificial intelligence safety, values encoding, robustness, and automated model evaluation.
- ğŸŒ± On the policy side, I'm quite interested in both the economics of AI and policy-relevant technical tools for climate adaptation.
