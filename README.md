- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Richard Ren â€“ @notrichardren â€“ and I'm interested in technical and policy-focused work. Currently, these two interests are functionally seperate, though I do hope to merge them in the future by creating policy-relevant technical projects.
- ğŸ‘€ On the technical side, I'm currently interested in artificial intelligence safety and machine learning model evaluation.
- ğŸŒ± On the policy side, I'm quite interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics, and I'm quite interested in both the economics of AI and climate economics.
