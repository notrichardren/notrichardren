- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Richard Ren. I'm interested in tech & policy related to artificial intelligence and climate change.
- ğŸ¤– On the technical research side, I'm currently interested in values encoding, robustness, and automated model evaluation. I've recently been working on a list of research proposals to improve safety in NLP systems.
- ğŸŒ± On the policy-relevant data analysis & software tools side, I'm quite interested in climate adaptation and using satellite data to proxy environmental or economic variables of interest.
