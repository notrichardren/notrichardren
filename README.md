# Hi, I'm Richard Ren 👋

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at the Jerome Fisher M&T Program at the University of Pennsylvania, specializing in AI safety and transparency research. My work focuses on evaluating and understanding large language models, particularly in the areas of:
- Model evaluations and benchmarking
- Steering model behaviors
- AI transparency and interpretability

## 🔬 Research Highlights

- Co-authored the most comprehensive empirical meta-analysis of AI safety benchmarks to date
- Work presented at the UK AI Safety Institute
- Research cited by OpenAI's Superalignment Fast Grants page
- Techniques incorporated into major open-source projects (llama.cpp, vLLM)

## 🧪 Research Style

I'm an experimentalist at heart with a quick, iterative, and empirically-driven approach. I like to focus on new potential research areas, rather than research that fits cleanly into pre-existing research areas.
