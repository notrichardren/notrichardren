- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Richard Ren. I'm interested in tech & policy related to artificial intelligence and climate change.
- ðŸ’“ On the technical research side, I'm currently interested in values encoding and embedding complex moral nuance in AI systems via RLHF, robustness, and automated model evaluation. I've recently been working on a list of research proposals to improve safety in NLP systems.
- ðŸŒ± On the policy-relevant data analysis & software tools side, I'm interested in climate adaptation and using satellite data to proxy environmental or economic variables of interest.
